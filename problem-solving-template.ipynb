This will run the notebook on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), a free online service for running Jupyter notebooks. \n\nThis tutorial is an executable [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org). You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.\n\n#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n\nThe easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.\n\n\n#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n\nTo run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.\n\n#### Saving your work\n\nBefore staring the assignment, let's save a snapshot of the assignment to your [Jovian](https://jovian.ai) profile, so that you can access it later, and continue your work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"project_name = ??? # give it an appropriate name","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Problem Statement\n\n\n> ???
