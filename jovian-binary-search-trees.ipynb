Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency\n\nWe can limit the number of iterations required for common operations like find, insert and update by organizing our data in the following structure, called a **binary tree**:\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lVqP63n.png\" width=\"520\">\n\n\n\nIt's called a tree because it vaguely like an inverted tree trunk with branches. \n* The word \"binary\" indicates that each \"node\" in the tree can have at most 2 children (left or right). \n* Nodes can have 0, 1 or 2 children. Nodes that do not have any children are sometimes also called \"leaves\".\n* The single node at the top is called the \"root\" node, and it typically where operations like search, insertion etc. begin.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/TZHMKJr.png\" width=\"400\">\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Balanced Binary Search Trees\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Mqef5b3.png\" width=\"520\">\n\nFor our use case, we require the binary tree to have some additional properties:\n\n1. **Keys and Values**: Each node of the tree stores a key (a username) and a value (a `User` object). Only keys are shown in the picture above for brevity. A binary tree where nodes have both a key and a value is often referred to as a **map** or **treemap** (because it maps keys to values).\n2. **Binary Search Tree**: The *left subtree* of any node only contains nodes with keys that are lexicographically smaller than the node's key, and the *right subtree* of any node only contains nodes with keys that lexicographically larger than the node's key. A tree that satisfies this property is called a **binary search trees**, and it's easy to locate a specific key by traversing a single path down from the root note.\n3. **Balanced Tree**: The tree is **balanced** i.e. it does not skew too heavily to one side or the other. The left and right subtrees of any node shouldn't differ in height/depth by more than 1 level.\n\n\n### Height of a Binary Tree\n\nThe number of levels in a tree is called its height. As you can tell from the picture above, each level of a tree contains twice as many nodes as the previous level. \n\nFor a tree of height `k`, here's a list of the number of nodes at each level:\n\nLevel 0: `1`\n\nLevel 1: `2`\n\nLevel 2: `4` i.e. `2^2`\n\nLevel 3: `8` i.e. `2^3`\n\n...\n\nLevel k-1: `2^(k-1)`\n\nIf the total number of nodes in the tree is `N`, then it follows that\n\n```\nN = 1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1)\n```\n\n\nWe can simplify this equation by adding `1` on each side:\n\n```\nN + 1 = 1 + 1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1) \n\nN + 1 = 2^1 + 2^1 + 2^2+ 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1) \n\nN + 1 = = 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1)\n\nN + 1 = = 2^3 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1)\n\n...\n\nN + 1 = 2^(k-1) + 2^(k-1)\n\nN + 1 = 2^k\n\nk = log(N + 1) <= log(N) + 1 \n\n```\n\nThus, to store `N` records we require a balanced binary search tree (BST) of height no larger than `log(N) + 1`. This is a very useful property, in combination with the fact that nodes are arranged in a way that makes it easy to find a specific key by following a single path down from the root. \n\nAs we'll see soon, the `insert`, `find` and `update` operations in a balanced BST have time complexity `O(log N)` since they all involve traversing a single path down from the root of the tree.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Binary Tree\n\n> **QUESTION 2**: Implement a binary tree using Python, and show its usage with some examples.\n\nTo begin, we'll create simple binary tree (without any of the additional properties) containing numbers as keys within nodes.

Interestingly, to create the left and right subtrees for the node, the `parse_tuple` function invokes itself. This technique is called _recursion_. The chain of _recursive_ calls ends when `parse_tuple` encounters a number or `None` as input.

Several decades of research has gone into creating self-balancing binary trees, and many approaches have been devised e.g. B-trees, Red Black Trees and  AVL (Adelson-Velsky Landis) trees.\n\nWe'll take a brief look at AVL trees. Self-balancing in AVL trees is achieved by tracking the *balance factor* (difference between the height of the left subtree and the right subtree) for each node and *rotating* unbalanced subtrees along the path of insertion/deletion to balance them.\n\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/AVL_Tree_Example.gif)\n\nIn a balanced BST, the balance factor of each node is either 0, -1, or 1. When we perform an insertion, then the balance factor of certain nodes along the path of insertion may change to 2 or -2. Those nodes can be \"rotated\" one-by-one to bring the balance factor back to 1, 0 or -1. \n\nThere are 4 different scenarios for balancing, two of which require a single rotation, while the others require 2 rotations:\n\n\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/0/1436854305-b167cc766c-AVL_Tree_Rebalancing.svg.png)\n\nSource: [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/self-balancing-tree/problem)\n\nSince each rotation takes constant time, and at most `log N` rotations may be required, this operation is far more efficient than creating a balanced binary tree from scratch, allowing insertion and deletion to be performed in `O (log N)` time. Here are some references for AVL Trees:\n\n* Explanation of the various cases: https://youtu.be/jDM6_TnYIqE?t=482\n* Implementation: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/avl-tree-set-1-insertion/\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Summary and Exercises\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lVqP63n.png)\n\nBinary trees form the basis of many modern programming language features (e.g. maps in C++ and Java) and data storage systems (filesystem indexes, relational databases like MySQL). You might wonder if dictionaries in Python are also binary search trees. They're not. They're hash tables, which is a different but equally interesting and important data structure. We'll explore hash tables in a future tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've covered a lot of ground this in this tutorial, including several common interview questions. Here are a few more problems you can try out:\n\n1. Implement rotations and self-balancing insertion\n1. Implement deletion of a node from a binary search tree\n2. Implement deletion of a node from a BST (with balancing)\n3. Find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree (Hint: Use the `parent` property)\n4. Find the next node in lexicographic order for a given node\n5. Given a number k, find the k-th node in a BST.\n\nTry more questions here: \n\n* https://medium.com/techie-delight/binary-tree-interview-questions-and-practice-problems-439df7e5ea1f\n* https://leetcode.com/tag/tree/\n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import jovian","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"jovian.commit()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
